# STM32TMrdo
Topmetal control and readout using STM32 and its internal ADC

# STM32H43ZITx NUCLEO-LQFP144
  - USB VCP (on OTG port) could be opened with `python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/cu.usbmodemFD131 115200`
  - PB1 (on CN12) is ADC12_INP5, which is a fast channel.

# STM32 ARM MCU firmware
  - `STM32CubeMX` is used to configure the pin function/clock and setup the basic software skeleton.
    - Make sure SYS->Debug = Serial Wire is selected.  Otherwise future flash writing will be disabled.
    - Choose `Makefile` under `Toolchain/IDE` for GNU-RM compatible skeleton.
    - Choose HAL set all free pins as analog and Enable full assert.
    - Make minimal modification to the generated code.  Place the majority of user code in separate files one level up to the generated code directory.
    - It seems asking the software to update the already generated files is not reliable.  Better delete all generated files and re-generate.
    - After copying the files over, run `cleanCube.sh` to clean up the file permissions and add additional information into `Makefile`.  New `makefile` is generated and `make` will pick up the new one automatically.  Modify `cleanCube.sh` accordingly when new `.c` files are added.
    - A new `main.c` is generated as well.  This way, no manual intervention to any of the STM32CubeMX generated files is needed.
## Useful commands
  - `readelf -a xxx.elf` or `objdump -h xxx.elf` to see the built image size.  Add up the size of all the loadable sections, such as `.text` and `.data`.  Look for the `LOAD` flag in the output from `objdump`.  Ignore non-loadable sections such as `.comment`, `.debug` and `.bss`.

  - [GNU](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
    - Download and put into `~/Applications/arm`.
    - `~/Applications/arm/env.sh`:
    ```
    #!/bin/sh

    ARMROOT=$HOME/Applications/arm
    export PATH=$ARMROOT/bin:$ARMROOT/arm-none-eabi/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARMROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export MANPATH=$ARMROOT/share/man:$MANPATH
    ```
    - `arm-none-eabi-objdump -d build/main.o` to see the assembly code generated by `gcc`.

    - Write firmware then start running:  `~/Applications/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer/STM32CubeProgrammer.app/Contents/MacOs/bin/STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD -w build/STM32H743ZITxCubeMX.hex -s`
    - For NUCLEO (-H7 at least), remember to hold down reset (black button), start the command, then release the button.
      - Enable Debug (SWD) in CubeMX project to solve this problem.
