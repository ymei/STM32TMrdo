Topmetal control and readout using STM32 and its internal ADC

# STM32H43ZITx NUCLEO-LQFP144
  - USB VCP (on OTG port) could be opened with `python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/cu.usbmodemFD131 115200`
  - PB1 (on CN12) is ADC12_INP5, which is a fast channel.
  - D-Cache could cause [DMA issues](https://community.st.com/s/article/FAQ-DMA-is-not-working-on-STM32H7-devices)
  - [Examples](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7) are very valuable.
## ADC
  - t_conv = 4.5 CLK (8bit) ~ 8.5 CLK (16bit), 1 CLK for every 2 bits.
  - t_samp >= 1.5 CLK.
  - 16-bit mode max sample rate is 3.6 Msps.
  - ADC1 and ADC2 are in AHB1/D2 (domain 2).
  - Fadc = 72MHz / 2 / a select factor.  Max is 36MHz (BOOST=1), 20MHz (BOOST=0).
    - The extra /2 factor is introduced by silicon revision V.
    - BOOST should be automatically handled by `HAL_ADC_Init()`.
    - In code, manually setting `hadc1.Init.ClockPrescaler = ADC_CLOCK_ASYNC_DIV1;` seems to work.

# STM32 ARM MCU firmware
  - `STM32CubeMX` is used to configure the pin function/clock and setup the basic software skeleton.
    - Make sure SYS->Debug = Serial Wire is selected.  Otherwise future flash writing will be disabled.
    - Choose `Makefile` under `Toolchain/IDE` for GNU-RM compatible skeleton.
    - Choose HAL set all free pins as analog and Enable full assert.
    - Choose copy all used libraries into the project folder so that `make` won't rely on independently installed Cube FW package (SDK).
    - Make minimal modification to the generated code.  Place the majority of user code in separate files one level up to the generated code directory.
    - It seems asking the software to update the already generated files is not reliable.  Better delete all generated files and re-generate.
    - After copying the files over, run `cleanCube.sh` to clean up the file permissions and add additional information into `Makefile`.  New `makefile` is generated and `make` will pick up the new one automatically.  Modify `cleanCube.sh` accordingly when new `.c` files are added.
    - A new `main.c` is generated as well.  This way, no manual intervention to any of the STM32CubeMX generated files is needed.
## Useful commands
  - `readelf -a xxx.elf` or `objdump -h xxx.elf` to see the built image size.  Add up the size of all the loadable sections, such as `.text` and `.data`.  Look for the `LOAD` flag in the output from `objdump`.  Ignore non-loadable sections such as `.comment`, `.debug` and `.bss`.

    - Write firmware then start running:  `~/Applications/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer/STM32CubeProgrammer.app/Contents/MacOs/bin/STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD -w build/STM32H743ZITxCubeMX.hex -s`
    - For NUCLEO (-H7 at least), remember to hold down reset (black button), start the command, then release the button.
      - Enable Debug (SWD) in CubeMX project to solve this problem.
